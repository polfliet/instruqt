title: Flex Integration - Build Your First Kubernetes Configuration
teaser: An introduction to creating configurations for the Flex Integration on New
  Relic's Infrastructure Agent
description: |-
  # Overview
  This track is an introduction to the [Flex Integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration) on New Relic's [Infrastructure Agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure).

  ## Requirements
  Completion of this track will require you to have access to your New Relic [License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). This can be from your paid New Relic account or from your free [Developer Edition](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/developer-edition-program) account.

  ## What is the Flex Integration?
  *From [How to Use New Relic Flex to Create Your Own Codeless Custom Integrations](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-use-new-relic-flex/)*

  "New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. Flex’s approach is different from that of dedicated integrations: Instead of interfacing directly with services, Flex instructs the New Relic Infrastructure agent to listen to standard structured output, which Flex then processes and collects as metric data for Infrastructure.

  With this approach, you can instrument any application that exposes metric data in some way or another, whether it’s from JSON over HTTP or from standard output in a shell session, and combine that data with all your other critical telemetry data in New Relic One. The amount of services you can instrument is only limited by the data sources supported by Flex, which are growing and are open for contribution. If a service can talk, chances are that Flex can listen."

  ## Important Note
  **This track utilizes an ephemeral kubernetes environment. As a result, you should be prepared to finish the entire track in one sitting or risk losing your progress when the timer expires.**

  title: Best Practice - Using Kubernetes Secrets
  teaser: Use a Kubernetes secret to store the New Relic license key
  assignment: "Kubernetes secrets are a great way to store passwords, private keys,
    and other sensitive information. The secrets can then be shared with pods and
    containers without having to pass them as plain text in your YAML files. You can
    find more information about Kubernetes secrets on the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).\n\nWe
    will create a Kubernetes secret that contains your New Relic License key. The
    License key will be used by the New Relic Observability agents to send data to
    the platform. \n\n# Get your New Relic license key\nFirst we need to retrieve
    your New Relic license key by logging in to your New Relic account, and clicking
    on Account Settings. \n\nIf you don't have an account yet you can create a free
    account on [New Relic.com](https://newrelic.com/signup).\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/nrlicense.gif?raw=true
    \"License key\")\n\n# Create the Kubernetes secret\nNext we are going to create
    the Kubernetes secret by copying the following command and **putting your license
    key between the quotes** before pressing enter.\n\n```\nkubectl create secret
    generic newrelic-secret --from-literal=new_relic_license_key='<LICENSE_KEY>'\n```\n\nYou
    can check if the secret was added succesfully by running \n```\nkubectl describe
    secret newrelic-secret\n```\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can delete the secret
    with \n```\nkubectl delete secret newrelic-secret\n```\n\nThe yaml files in the
    rest of this tutorial will refer to this *newrelic-secret* to retrieve the license
    key. \n"

  title: Kubernetes health with kube-state-metrics
  teaser: Deploy kube-state-metrics
  assignment: "During this step we will install [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics),
    a service that exposes metrics about the various Kubernetes objects. These metrics
    can then be picked up by monitoring agents to provide information on the health
    and performance of your Kubernetes cluster. \n\n# Installing kube-state-metrics\n\nDownload
    kube-state-metrics version 1.7.2 from Github\n```\ncurl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.7.2.zip
    https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.7.2.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.7.2.zip\n```\n\nInstall
    kube-state-metrics in the cluster\n```\nkubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.7.2/kubernetes\n```\n\nConfirm
    that kube-state-metrics is installed (this might take a minute)\n```\nkubectl
    get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics\n```\n\nAfter a while, you
    should see something like:\n![alt text](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/ksm.png?raw=true
    \"Kube-state-metrics\")\n\n# Looking at the data\n\nLet's take a sneak peak at
    the data that's being retrieved by kube-state-metrics. \nFind out on which IP
    address the kube-state-metrics service is running:\n\n```\nkubectl get svc kube-state-metrics
    -n kube-system\n```\n\nYou can use the CLUSTER-IP address with `curl` to view
    the metrics.\n\n```\ncurl http://<IP_ADDRESS>:8080/metrics\n```\n\nThe metrics
    format is based off the Prometheus standard, which we will cover later in the
    workshop. "
