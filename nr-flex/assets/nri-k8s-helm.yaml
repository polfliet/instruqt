# If you wish to monitor services running on Kubernetes you can provide integrations
# configuration under integrations_config. You just need to create a new entry where
# the "name" is the filename of the configuration file and the data is the content of
# the integration configuration. The name must end in ".yaml" as this will be the
# filename generated and the Infrastructure agent only looks for YAML files. The data
# part is the actual integration configuration as described in the spec here:
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180

# For more details on monitoring services on Kubernetes see
