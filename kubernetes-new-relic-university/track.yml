  title: Best Practice - Using Kubernetes secrets
  teaser: Use a Kubernetes secret to store the New Relic license key
  assignment: "Kubernetes secrets are a great way to store passwords, private keys,
    and other sensitive information. The secrets can then be shared with pods and
    containers without having to pass them as plain text in your YAML files. You can
    find more information about Kubernetes secrets on the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).\n\nWe
    will create a Kubernetes secret that contains your New Relic License key. The
    License key will be used by the New Relic Observability agents to send data to
    the platform. \n\n# Get your New Relic license key\nFirst we need to retrieve
    your New Relic license key by logging in to your New Relic account, and clicking
    on Account Settings. \n\nIf you don't have an account yet you can create a free
    account on [New Relic.com](https://newrelic.com/signup).\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/nrlicense.gif?raw=true
    \"License key\")\n\n# Create the Kubernetes secret\nNext we are going to create
    the Kubernetes secret by copying the following command and **putting your license
    key between the quotes** before pressing enter.\n\n```\nkubectl create secret
    generic newrelic-secret --from-literal=new_relic_license_key='<LICENSE_KEY>'\n```\n\nYou
    can check if the secret was added succesfully by running \n```\nkubectl describe
    secret newrelic-secret\n```\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can delete the secret
    with \n```\nkubectl delete secret newrelic-secret\n```\n\nThe yaml files in the
    rest of this tutorial will refer to this *newrelic-secret* to retrieve the license
    key. \n"

  assignment: "During this step we will deploy the New Relic Kubernetes integration
    to our cluster.\n\nTo achieve this we are going to deploy a DaemonSet into our

  title: Best Practice - Using resource requests & resource limits
  teaser: Control capacity in your cluster
  assignment: "When you deploy a container with K8s it will be automatically scheduled
    on a node with available capacity. This provides a unique challenge as you don't
    know where your container will end up. \n\nImagine you have a container that's
    very memory intensive and it gets deployed on a node with a limited amount of
    available memory. Within minutes your container will put the node under stress,
    and K8s will automatically start removing pods to keep the node stable.\n\nAnother
    scenario is where a container on a node starts consuming all of the CPU. All of
    a sudden the other container on that node will start slowing down because they
    need to wait on resources to become available.\n\nTo avoid these scenarios you
    can set **resource requests and limits** on K8s containers. \n* A **resource request**
    make sure that there are enough resources available on a node before a container
    gets scheduled. \n* A **resource limit** limits the amount of CPU and memory a
    container can use. \n\nGood to know:\n* A container will be throttled when it
    reaches the cpu limit. \n* A memory limit behaves differently as K8s will kill
    the pod when the container uses more than the specified limit.\n\nAn example config
    is available in the `Editor` tab. Open the file `worker.yaml` and look for the
    following configuration parameters:\n\n```\nresources:\n    requests:\n        cpu:
    50m\n        memory: 100Mi\n    limits:\n        cpu: 200m\n        memory: 300Mi\n```\n\nHere
    is your challenge: Add resource requests and limits to the RabbitMQ pod that's
    running in this environment. The config file is available under the `Editor` tab
    in the file `rabbitmq.yaml`. (use the same values as the above example and don't
    forget to save the file in the editor. Pay attention to the indentation!)\n\nYou
    can apply the changes with \n```\nkubectl apply -f rabbitmq.yaml -n demo-app\n```
    \nand check if the resources are correctly set with \n```\nkubectl describe -n
    demo-app pod rabbitmq\n``` \n\n# Kubernetes Cluster Explorer\nGo back to the Kubernetes
    Cluster Explorer. New Relic tracks resource requests and limits so you can visualize
    them and alert on them.\n\nFor example: Use the search bar to find the Worker
    deployment and click on the Pod to see more details.\n\nYou should see something
    like this:\n![Resources](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/resources.png?raw=true
    \"Resources\")\n\nThe blue line represents the actual resource consumption, while
    the yellow line indicates the request and the red line indicates the limit.\n\n**Good
    to know**: \n* New Relic creates a default alert that warns when a pod is reaching
    its cpu or memory limit\n* Default alerts can be found by Navigating to Alerts
    and inspecting the '*Kubernetes default alert policy*'"

  title: New Relic Kubernetes Events integration
  teaser: Correlate Kubernetes events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer
  assignment: |-
    Many things can happen in a Kubernetes environment (autoscaling, new deployments, resource contention, etc.). All these important events are registered by the Kubernetes API server.

    We can inspect what's happening by manually doing:
    ```
    kubectl get events
    ```

    During this step we will deploy the New Relic Kubernetes events integration to our cluster. This will provide us with Kubernetes events in context of our Kubernetes Cluster Explorer.

    # Install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration
    The yaml file is already available on our machine, we can apply it:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f nri-k8s-events.yaml
    ```

    Confirm the Pod is running
    ```

  title: Best Practice - Using health checks
  teaser: Using Kubernetes health checks
  assignment: |-
    Kubernetes supports two types of health checks:
    * **Readiness probes**: Used by Kubernetes to know when your container is ready to handle traffic.
    * **Liveness probes**: Use to periodically check if your container is still healthy. Otherwise it will be restarted by Kubernetes.

    # Check our healthz API endpoint
    The *frontend* pod we have running, is exposing a health API endpoint to check if this microservice is still healthy. Let's check this out!

    We first need the IP address of the pod. Our frontend pod is running in the demo-app namespace (*-n demo-app*) and we can select by using a label (*-l tier=frontend*)
    ```
    kubectl describe pod -n demo-app -l tier=frontend | grep IP
    ```

    Then let's get the response of our healthz API endpoint (it runs on port 3000):
    ```
    curl http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000/healthz
    ```

    # Build a Kubernetes Liveness probe
    We can use this API endpoint as a liveness probe. Kubernetes will periodically check this endpoint and restart the container if it fails.

    Copy the following livenessProbe into **frontend.yaml** and save it (See parser.yaml for an example. Pay attention to the indentation!).
    ```
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 3000
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 5
    ```
    Now let's apply the yaml file.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml -n demo-app
    ```

    # Kubernetes Cluster Explorer
    Go back to the cluster explorer and click on the *Events* tab.

    You should see a list of all events happening in the cluster:
    ![Events](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/events.png?raw=true "Events")

    Now go back to the cluster explorer, search and click on the *frontend* pod. In the meantime, our Liveness probe should have failed a couple of times and you should see it in the context of the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer:

  title: Using Distributed Tracing
  teaser: Trace your microservices
  assignment: |
    Many services could be communicating in a Kubernetes environment, Distributed Tracing allows us to track and understand that communication.

    * A distributed trace represents a unique transaction that flows through your microservice environment
    * A trace consists of spans, which represent a unit of work (e.g.: code execution on 1 microservice)
    ![Distributed Tracing](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/dt-intro.png?raw=true "Distributed Tracing")

    # Kubernetes Cluster Explorer
    Go back to the Cluster Explorer. Search for the 'frontend' deployment and click on the pod.

    Because we have an APM agent running in the container, we can see application details in the context of this pod. You should see something like this:
    ![APM details](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/pod-apm.png?raw=true "APM")

    Click on *'Trace this application'* to show relevant traces for the service running inside this pod.

    Now we see an overview of all traces that were captured:
    ![Distributed Traces](https://github.com/polfliet/instruqt/blob/master/kubernetes-new-relic-university/screenshots/dt-overview.png?raw=true "Distributed Traces")

    * How many entities were involved in this trace?
    * How much time are we spending in each service?

    ```
    kubectl logs -n demo-app -l tier=parser
    ```

    But, we don't want to switch between tools, we want to get those logs in context of our Kubernetes Clusterr Explorer!

    # Kubernetes Cluster Explorer
    Go back to the open tab with our Kubernetes Cluster Explorer.

    Search and click on the *Parser* pod, click on the *See logs* button.

    You should see something like:
