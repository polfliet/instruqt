  title: Set Up New Relic Infrastructure
  teaser: Configure the New Relic Infrastructure Agent
  assignment: |-
    We will be working on a single virtual machine that will host several Docker containers.
    The New Relic Infrastructure agent has been installed on this host, but it hasn't been configured yet.

    Start by creating a configuration file containing your license key by running the following command in the terminal to the right:
    ```
    echo "license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" | tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
    ```
    Then restart the agent for the settings to take effect:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra
    ```
